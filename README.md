- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmmanuelGirin
- 👀 I’m interested in continuing to hone my programming ability across a multiple range of projects. 
        I'd like to continue learning data management and science skills, so that I can find projects that advance the connection of humanity and helps the disenfranchised. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Java, Python, manage databases, and starting to broaden my scope to CRMs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that improve social services to the disenfranchised and anything involving programming, so that I can continue to learn and grow my skills. 
- 📫 How to reach me contact me here on Github or through linkedin Emmanuel Girin
